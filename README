Use jMasterPage for use of Master Pages through AJAX.

It uses jQuery to replace the contents of a html tag defined on initialization to call ajax requests on other pages.

It changes the active and inactive class links on the master page using the classes 'jmsActive' for the pages that you can reach 

(other pages) and 'jmsInactive' for the actual page.


Usage:

- make your Master Page using only HTML.

- add a placeholder (ex.: div) where your page contents will reside.

- add a script tag for initialize jMasterPage.
ex.:

$("#content").jmasterpage();

- add other pages without all the "html", "head" and "body", only the content inside the placeholder.

- you're ready to go! Every link on the website will use the placeholder to render its contents.


Options:

You can use the options bellow for personalization:

home -> set the first page of your site if you have one, so you can call it again through other pages.
